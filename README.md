# Aram-AZ

## Overview

Aram-AZ is a project inspired by discussions with friends about a specific League of Legends gamemode. The aim of this project is to help users track the champions (playable characters) they have been randomly assigned to play until all 168 champions have been played. The platform also features a club system where users can join clubs and compete with each other to see who can complete the challenge first.

## Technologies

 For this project I decided to use Next.js as a full-stack solution and supabase for the database and authentication. I believe this stack is suited for this project because of the ease of use and the speed of development as well as scalability for a rather small-scale project.

## Pages

- **Home Page**: The landing page of Aram-AZ, where users can get an overview of the application.
- **Demo**: A page for potential users to see the application in action without having to sign up.
- **Profile**: A page where users can update and see their current progress.
- **Club Page**: A dedicated area for users to create clubs, view club members, and compete in the challenge.
- **Club Join**: A page users go by visiting a previously generated invite url to join a club.

## Future Plans

- **Riot API**: I plan to hook up the application to the Riot API to get the latest information on champions, matches and their stats automatically.
